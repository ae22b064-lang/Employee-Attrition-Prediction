# Predictive Analysis of Employee Turnover using Decision Tree Classification

This project demonstrates the use of a **Decision Tree Classifier** to analyze and predict **employee attrition**.  
By identifying key factors that drive turnover, organizations can make informed HR decisions to improve employee retention.  
It also serves as a practical demonstration of applying **machine learning and recursive algorithms** to solve real-world business problems.

## Project Highlights
- **Machine Learning Application** → Built a classification model to predict employee attrition (Yes/No) using structured HR data.  
- **DSA Connection** → Demonstrated understanding of **recursive algorithms** through the implementation of a Decision Tree, a fundamental data structure.  
- **Data Preprocessing** → Handled both numerical and categorical variables, applying **one-hot encoding** and feature scaling where necessary.  
- **Model Interpretation** → Leveraged the interpretability of decision trees to **visualize decision rules** and identify key attrition drivers.
