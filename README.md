Predictive Analysis of Employee Turnover using Decision Tree Classification
This project utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to analyze and predict employee attrition, helping organizations identify factors that contribute to employee turnover. It serves as a practical demonstration of applying machine learning to solve a real-world human resources problem.

Project Highlights
Machine Learning Application: Developed a classification model to predict a binary outcome (attrition: Yes/No) from a structured dataset.

DSA Connection: Showcased knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms by leveraging the Decision Tree, a classic example of a recursive algorithm that builds a tree data structure to partition data.

Data Preprocessing: Handled a mixed dataset of numerical and categorical features, employing techniques like one-hot encoding to prepare the data for the model.

Model Interpretation: Utilized the inherent interpretability of a decision tree to visualize the model's decision-making process, providing actionable insights into the key drivers of attrition.
